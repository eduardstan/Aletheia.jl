# Aletheia.jl

Aletheia is a syntax-first foundation for propositional, modal,
many-valued, and first-order logic. Its first layer defines Blackburn-style
similarity types, immutable hash-consed formulas, extensible connective
traits, and precedence-aware parsing and printing. Semantics and evaluation
are deliberately left to later stages.

Its design is grounded in five references:

- Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema, *Modal Logic* [blackburn2001](@cite).
- Goranko, *Logic as a Tool: A Guide to Formal Logical Reasoning* [goranko2016](@cite).
- Schwarz, *Logic 2: Modal Logic* [schwarz2024](@cite).
- Muggleton and De Raedt, “Inductive Logic Programming: Theory and Methods” [muggleton1994](@cite).
- Železný and Lavrač (eds), *Inductive Logic Programming: 18th International Conference, ILP 2008* [zelezny2008](@cite).

The references are provided for scholarly grounding; their source PDFs are not
redistributed with this package.
